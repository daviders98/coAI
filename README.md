Problem 1: Collaborative Notes App

Objective: Develop a React (or React Native) application that allows users to create, edit, and share notes in real-time. Your focus should be on state management, UI responsiveness, and handling concurrent edits efficiently.

Requirements:

Home Screen:

Display a list of user-created notes with timestamps.

Allow users to create new notes and delete existing ones.

Note Editing Screen:

Implement a rich-text editor for formatting (bold, italic, underline, lists).

Allow multiple users to edit a note in real-time (simulate real-time updates).

Handle conflicts when two users edit the same note simultaneously.

Performance Optimization:

Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Implement lazy loading for large note lists.

Use memoization and efficient data structures to handle frequent updates smoothly.

Constraints:

Emphasize clean, maintainable code with meaningful comments.

Hardcode a small set of notes in local storage.

Include basic tests for key components.

Submission:

Provide your submission via a GitHub repository.

Include setup instructions to run the app.

Document your optimization choices.
